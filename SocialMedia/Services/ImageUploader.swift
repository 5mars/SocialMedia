/// 2.    Image data is obtained from the UIImage and compressed with a quality of 0.5.
/// 3.    A unique filename is generated using NSUUID.
/// 4.    A reference to the Firebase Storage path is created.
/// 5.    The image data is uploaded asynchronously to Firebase Storage.
/// 6.    The download URL of the uploaded image is retrieved and returned as a string.
/// 7.    If any errors occur during the upload process, an error message is printed, and nil is returned.
